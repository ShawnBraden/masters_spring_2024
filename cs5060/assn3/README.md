# Comments on the code:
## Part 1
The beta distribution only allows the stock to increase. I played around with the parameters of the Beta distribution and it fixed the problem, however the we were told to use (20, 8) - 0.25. I also used the code Mario provided. I made a few small changes to it, but I didn't see a need to change what was provided. 

## Part 2 
In this part I first looked at fitting the distributions. P.S. I spent a long time trying to figure out graphing and turning off the logging, but this repo seems to follow the "My way or the high way" mentality. So unfortunately the graphs are on two figures, can the terminal gets spammed with a bunch of useless logs. Sorry about that. Other than that the code just follows the simulations asked from by the assignment then reports on it.
